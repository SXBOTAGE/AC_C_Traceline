# AssaultCube_External
Basic Assault Cube external cheat in C for the version 1.2.0.2

# Descrition

External cheat in C that use a injected traceline wrapper to verify if the ennemy is visible with CreateRemoteThread. It will store each entity visibility value in 1 bit making a total of 32 bit. 
The cheat then read the value and check if the bit is set for the entity specified.

The **rest of the code may no be interesting since it's a basic (?BAD?) coded cheat in few days that do not even use multi-threading**. I just **let the cheat here if someone wanted to use a "traceline"** in a external way.
